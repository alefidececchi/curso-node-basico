# api REST
Node.js Curse

- this is a REST server that you can use to manage documents call it "usuarios"
- there are some middlewares to optimize the system 
- REST server includes CRUD operations
- it's possible (or not) the code contains some errros, but if you find some of them, ignore it... i'm just learning
